when offline only adafruit stuff loadas, i guess server rendered stuff?

do i really want to rewrite te parsing library or make it work with micropython?

Should I purchse a new board?

I could have both, the easy circuitpython way or the cheap micropython way... nothing wrong with either

I need to quit shopping, I should just use what I have, learn from it and just get what I have working.
